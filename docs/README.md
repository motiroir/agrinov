# AgriNov - Management App for an AMAP

![agrinov intro](images/agrinov-intro.png)

## Introduction
AgriNov is a digital platform designed to support AMAPs (Associations for the Maintenance of Small-Scale Farming) initiatives. Based in Clisson, France, AgriNov embodies values of solidarity, equity, and transparency by fostering direct partnerships between local producers and consumers. Our project aims to enhance the AMAP experience through an intuitive digital platform, simplifying order management, community interactions, and workshop organization.

## Context & Challenges
Traditional AMAPs face challenges such as administrative burdens, lack of flexibility, and barriers to digital adoption. Our goal is to address these challenges by:
- Streamlining member and order management.
- Providing a seamless online platform for producers and consumers.
- Maintaining human connections through in-person workshops and events.

### Benefits of Digitalization
- **Simplified Management**: Automates member registration, order processing, and subscription management.
- **Increased Flexibility**: Enables users to customize their orders and adjust consumption.
- **Enhanced Communication**: Facilitates information sharing about seasonal products and farming practices.
- **Time-Saving**: Reduces administrative overhead, allowing organizers to focus on community engagement.

### Potential Risks
- **Loss of Human Interaction**: To mitigate this, AgriNov promotes regular in-person gatherings and workshops.
- **Digital Literacy Barriers**: The platform is designed with an intuitive interface to accommodate users with limited technical skills.
